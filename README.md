Named for Mrs. Lott, the worst teacher I ever had, and her classroom projector.

## Hardware

> The embedded PCB design isn't finalized yet. Build the prototype on a breadboard or perfboard using the [prototype schematic](hardware/prototype.kicad_sch).

The full design targets a custom PCB with an RP2040, MOSFET-switched IR LED array, USB-C, and external flash. Five KiCad schematics cover the main board, power regulation, flash memory, USB connector, and a simplified prototype variant.

## Firmware

The [CircuitPython firmware](firmware/code.py) implements a standard NEC protocol engine:

- 38kHz carrier modulation via `pulseio.PulseOut`
- Listens for 4-byte NEC arrays over USB serial
- Drives a status LED and the IR output on GPIO
- Header: 9000&micro;s mark / 4500&micro;s space
- Bit coding: 560&micro;s mark + 1690&micro;s (1) or 560&micro;s (0)
- Compatible with any NEC IR receiver

```python
import time
import board
import pwmio

# 38kHz carrier wave initialization
ir_pwm = pwmio.PWMOut(board.GP16, frequency=38000, duty_cycle=0)

def pulse_nec(mark_us, space_us):
    # Enable carrier wave modulation for duration of mark
    ir_pwm.duty_cycle = 32768  # 50% duty cycle
    time.sleep_us(mark_us)

    # Disable carrier wave modulation for duration of space
    ir_pwm.duty_cycle = 0
    time.sleep_us(space_us)
```

## Web Interface

Two pages are served via GitHub Pages:

| Page | Description |
|---|---|
| **Landing Page** (`index.html`) | Project overview, BOM table, KiCanvas schematic viewer, architecture docs, features, setup guide |
| **Controller** (`controller.html`) | Full WebSerial-based remote control app with library management, IRDB browser, signal composer, and transmit history |

## Setup & Flash

> Build the prototype on a breadboard or perfboard using the [prototype schematic](hardware/prototype.kicad_sch).

<details>
<summary><strong>DIY / Prototype Only</strong>: Steps 1 and 2 (skip if you have a pre-assembled unit)</summary>

### Step 1: Enter Bootloader Mode

Press and hold the **BOOT** button on the board, then connect it to your computer via a data-capable USB cable. Release the button once the drive mounts.

### Step 2: Install CircuitPython

A mass storage volume named `RPI-RP2` will appear. Drag and drop the appropriate CircuitPython `.uf2` payload onto its root directory. The board will automatically reboot and remount as `CIRCUITPY`.

</details>

### Step 3: Deploy Firmware

Copy the contents of `firmware/` onto the `CIRCUITPY` volume root:

- `code.py`
- `lib/`

### Step 4: Plug It In & Open the Controller

Keep the device connected via USB, then open the [web controller](https://chaowoses.github.io/LottBespittingDiode/controller.html) in a Chromium-based browser. Click **Connect** to establish the WebSerial session.

To run locally (required for development):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chaowoses/LottBespittingDiode.git
cd LottBespittingDiode
python -m http.server 8080
# open http://localhost:8080
```

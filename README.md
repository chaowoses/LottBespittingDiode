# Lott-Bespitting Diode (LBD)

The **Lott-Bespitting Diode (LBD)** is a custom, high-intensity infrared (IR) blaster built on the RP2040 microcontroller. It uses a high-output, MOSFET-driven IR array to transmit standard 38kHz infrared signals (like the NEC protocol) directly from a browser interface over a USB serial connection.

# 1. System Architecture Overview

The system splits functionality symmetrically between an on-board hardware driver and a web-based serial terminal pipeline.

# 2. Hardware Design & Schematics

*Schematic diagrams, 3D PCB renders, and assembly images will be uploaded once complete.*

# 3. Embedded Firmware Architecture

The firmware layer runs on top of a an internal clock loop to translate explicit string structures into precise, microsecond-timed hardware actions.

## Core Operations

* **NEC Protocol Synthesis:** Encodes raw hexadecimal data pairs (Address and Command) into standard NEC pulse-distance sequences
* **Carrier Modulation:** Generates a consistent, hardware-accurate 38kHz duty cycle inside the transmission window to pass standard consumer IR receiver filters
* **USB Data Ingestion:** Runs a non-blocking serial listen routine tracking inbound raw string inputs

## Example Firmware Loop

```python
import time
import board
import pwmio

# 38kHz carrier wave initialization
ir_pwm = pwmio.PWMOut(board.GP16, frequency=38000, duty_cycle=0)

def pulse_nec(mark_us, space_us):
    # Enable carrier wave modulation for duration of mark
    ir_pwm.duty_cycle = 32768  # 50% duty cycle
    time.sleep_us(mark_us)

    # Disable carrier wave modulation for duration of space
    ir_pwm.duty_cycle = 0
    time.sleep_us(space_us)
```

# 4. Setup & Flash Instructions

Depending on how you acquired your LBD system, select the appropriate configuration pipeline below.

## Option A — Plug-and-Play (Pre-Assembled Hardware)

If you received an assembled unit, the firmware layer is pre-flashed.

1. Plug the hardware unit directly into a USB port on your machine
2. Launch the control interface panel
3. Utilize the hosted web environment or follow the Local Interface Setup instructions below

## Option B — From-Scratch Assembly (DIY Build)

### Step 1 — Enter Bootloader Mode

Press and hold the **BOOT** button on the PCB, then connect it to your computer via a data-capable USB cable.

Release the button once the drive mounts.

### Step 2 — Mount Volume

A new mass storage volume named `RPI-RP2` will appear.

### Step 3 — Install CircuitPython

Drag and drop the appropriate CircuitPython `.uf2` payload directly onto the root directory of the `RPI-RP2` volume.

The board will automatically reboot and remount as:

```text
CIRCUITPY
```

### Step 4 — Deploy Application Code

Open the `/firmware` directory within this project workspace.

Copy the following onto the root of the `CIRCUITPY` volume:

* `code.py`
* `lib/`

---

# 5. Local Interface Setup

Because the Web Serial API requires a secure cross-origin network context, you cannot run the control interface panel directly using a raw `file://` payload.

## Launch Local Development Server

```bash
# 1. Navigate into the software workspace
cd lbd-project-portfolio/software

# 2. Launch a lightweight local server
python -m http.server 8080

# 3. Open the frontend dashboard
http://localhost:8080
```
